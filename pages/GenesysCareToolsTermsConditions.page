<p><strong>3. Changes to the Tools</strong></p>

<p>Your requests for bug fixes and enhancements will be tracked as Support Cases or Feature Requests in the Customer Care case management system. Genesys reserves the right to update these tools and/or related documentation with no obligation to you.

<br/>
<p><strong>4. Changes to these Terms and Conditions </strong></p>

<p>Genesys may make changes to the Genesys Care Tools Terms and Conditions at its sole discretion. If we make any changes to these Terms and Conditions, we will notify you by posting the new version of the Terms on the Genesys Customer Care website. It is your own responsibility to check the website for such postings from time to time. You may also be asked to re-acknowledge and reaccept the Terms following any material changes. Your continued use of the tools following the posting or other notice of changes to the Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>5. Proprietary Rights and License</strong></p>

<p>All trademarks, copyrights, database rights and other intellectual property rights of any nature in these tools together with the underlying software code are owned directly by Genesys.</p>

<p><strong>6. Data Protection</strong></p>

<p>Genesys is strongly committed to preserving the privacy of its customers. We maintain strict security standards and procedures with a view to preventing unauthorized access to your data by anyone, including our staff. We use leading technologies such as (but not limited to) data encryption, firewalls and server authentication to protect the security of your data.

However, Genesys does not assume any responsibility for the protection of any confidential data that you may send to us using the Genesys Care Tools, and Genesys has no need to transmit, store, or process sensitive data.</p>

<p>When reporting product-related issues to Genesys Customer Care, it may be helpful to provide output from these tools as extra information. However, Genesys is not responsible for the accuracy of data provided using these tools.</p>

<p>The Genesys Customer Care suite of tools does <u>not</u> support GDPR access or erasure requests. In order to meet EU GDPR (European Union General Data Protection Regulation) compliance, customers/partners should reference the respective Tool User Guide(s) for GDPR compliant information and recommendations.</p>

<br/>
<p><strong>7. Warnings</strong></p>

<p>Some of these tools will interact directly with your Genesys deployment. Therefore, use caution when using these tools in a production environment. Some examples:</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Log File Management Tool (LFMT):</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the log configuration and log volume, changing the log level to a higher priority or specifying a more frequent log collection interval may cause a greater number of outputs and therefore larger logs. This could affect system performance. Likewise, changing the log level to a lower verbosity or specifying a less frequent log collection interval may cause log events to not be logged at all, or to not be logged to specific levels, thereby losing important information. The same applies to any alarms associated with a particular log event.</p>
<br/>
<p>LFMT could affect network performance. Please read the documentation carefully before deploying LFMT in a production environment. Be aware that LFMT will consume network and application server resources. Capacity planning is strongly recommended before deploying LFMT.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Alarm Monitoring:</strong></p>

<p>Alarm monitoring will require alarm messages to be sent across the network to the Genesys Monitoring Center. Genesys is not responsible for the security of messages sent over the network.</p>
<br/>

<p><strong>Workbench:</strong></p>
<p>Workbench could affect network performance. Please read the documentation carefully before deploying Workbench in a production environment. Be aware that Workbench will consume network and application server resources. Capacity planning is strongly recommended before deploying Workbench.</p>
<br/>
<p>Data collected by Workbench (including metrics, alarms, changes in configuration files, and log events) is stored locally in the customer environment.  The customer is responsible for protecting this data.</p>

<br/>
<p><strong>8. Third Party Libraries</strong></p>

<p>Certain third-party libraries used by these tools are open source technology subject to licensing terms of those third parties.
