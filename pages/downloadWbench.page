   Also included are a set of proprietary tools to help you troubleshoot issues and speed up problem resolution.

Workbench as a standalone application is powerful, but by adding one or more of the following tools, you can increase the efficiency of Workbench, receive richer data regarding your Genesys system, and make it easier to keep your environment at peak performance. 
</p><br/>

<p><a  href="/customercare/downloadTool?pageType=Log" target="_blank">Log File Management Tool (LFMT)</a> – provides a central repository for the storage of application log files, and an interface for retrieving a set of specified log files. Access to log files is essential to troubleshooting and allows you to quickly upload sanitized files to support cases to aid Customer Care with issue resolution. 
Available to all Genesys Care subscribers.
</p><br/>

<p><a  href="/customercare/alarmTool?pageType=Alarm" target="_blank">Remote Alarm Monitoring with Workbench</a> – monitors your environment 24/7 to prevent and mitigate issues before they occur and sends alarm notifications using the Genesys Care Mobile App so you receive critical alarm notifications anytime and anywhere. 
With Remote Alarm Monitoring plus LFMT, you can authorize Customer Care to employ proactive log file retrieval and securely access your log files when an alarm is triggered, thus identifying and resolving the issue more quickly. 
Remote Alarm Monitoring is included with Business Care Plus and Premium Care; or as a Flex Care add-on to Business Care.
</p><br/>

<p>Remote Alarm Monitoring is now integrated with Workbench and requires the installation and deployment of Workbench before Remote Alarm Monitoring can be activated.
