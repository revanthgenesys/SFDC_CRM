<br/>
<p>2.1.2.1&nbsp; Unmodified Code.&nbsp; You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.2.1 (a)&nbsp; You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.2.1 (b)&nbsp; You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 2.</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.2.2&nbsp; Modified Code.&nbsp; You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.2.2 (a)&nbsp; You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code;</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.2.2 (b)&nbsp; You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.2.2 (c)&nbsp; If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available.&nbsp; Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.2.3&nbsp; Distribution of Executable Versions.&nbsp; In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.&nbsp;</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.2.4&nbsp; Third Party Rights.&nbsp; You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code.</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.3&nbsp; Your Grants.&nbsp; In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.&nbsp;</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.4&nbsp; Larger Works.&nbsp; You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.&nbsp; In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.5&nbsp; Limitations on Patent License.&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.&nbsp;</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.6&nbsp; Additional Terms.&nbsp; You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein (&quot;Additional Terms&quot;) to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.</p>
<br/>
<p>2.1.7&nbsp; Versions of the License.&nbsp; Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time.&nbsp; Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version.

<br/>
<p>3.1&nbsp; Android SDK and Google API are subject to the Google SDK License terms below.</p>
<br/>
<p>This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement November 13, 2012 <a  style="font-weight:bold; color:blue;" href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/terms.html" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/sdk/terms.html</a></p>
<br/>
<p>3.1.1 Introduction</p>
<br/>
<p>3.1.1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in this License Agreement as the &quot;SDK&quot; and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of this License Agreement. This License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.</p>
<br/>
<p>3.1.1.2 &ldquo;Android&rdquo; means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL: http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.</p>
<br/>
<p>3.1.1.3 &quot;Google&quot; means Google Inc., a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.</p>
<br/>
<p>3.1.2 Accepting this License Agreement</p>
<br/>
<p>3.1.2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to this License Agreement. You may not use the SDK if you do not accept this License Agreement.</p>
<br/>
<p>3.1.2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of this License Agreement.</p>
<br/>

<br/>
<p>3.1.2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by this License Agreement on behalf of your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to this License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.</p>
<br/>
<p>3.1.3 SDK License from Google</p>
<br/>
<p>3.1.3.1 Subject to the terms of this License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the SDK solely to develop applications to run on the Android platform.</p>
<br/>
<p>3.1.3.2 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. &quot;Intellectual Property Rights&quot; means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
<br/>
<p>3.1.3.3 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by this License Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not: (a) copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK; or (b) load any part of the SDK onto a mobile handset or any other hardware device except a personal computer, combine any part of the SDK with other software, or distribute any software or device incorporating a part of the SDK.</p>
<br/>
<p>3.1.3.4 You agree that you will not take any actions that may cause or result in the fragmentation of Android, including but not limited to distributing, participating in the creation of, or promoting in any way a software development kit derived from the SDK.</p>

<br/>
<p>3.1.3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK.

<p>3.1.4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under this License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.</p>
<br/>

<br/>
<p>3.1.4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users.
