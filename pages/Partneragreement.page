<p>
    8.  <b>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER</b></p>
   <p> GENESYS MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WITH RESPECT TO ANY GENESYS PRODUCTS OR THE DEVELOPER MATERIALS AND GENESYS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY/ MERCHANTABLE QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.     </p>
<p>
    9. <b> INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</b></p>
<p>a.  Genesys retains all Intellectual Property Rights in relation to the Partner Program, including without limitation, Intellectual Property Rights in and to Genesys Products, Developer Materials, Derivative Works, Genesys Marks, and Genesys training materials.  Participant shall retain all rights, title, and interest in and to Participant Products and Developed Works.</p>
<p>b.  Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Master Agreement, nothing is intended to grant to either party any licenses or rights to any Intellectual Property Rights of the other party.</p>
<p>c.  Participant shall not develop any product with functionality comparable to any Genesys Products using or referencing any Genesys Confidential Information or intellectual property, including products that are the same as or substantially similar to current Genesys’s general availability, beta, and announced products.  </p>
<p>d.  Each party shall be responsible for taking any action or initiating any proceedings which such party, at its sole discretion, determines to be necessary or appropriate to prevent any infringement of its Intellectual Property Rights, and/or to preserve the validity and enforceability of its, or its licensors’, rights, title, and interest in and to its Intellectual Property Rights. Each party shall render to the other party all reasonably requested assistance in relation to such actions or proceedings. Each party agrees that it shall promptly notify the other party: (i) of any and all violations or misappropriations of the other party’s Intellectual Property Rights (including without limitation, infringements, imitations, illegal use, or misuse) by any third party, of which it is or becomes aware; and (ii) of any claims or notifications that such party’s use of the Genesys Products infringes or may infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party.  </p>
<p>e.  In addition to the foregoing, in the case of Participant’s Users, Participant agrees that it shall promptly notify Genesys of an actual or possible violation of the User license agreement or actual or possible infringement of Genesys’s Intellectual Property Rights, and enforce the User license agreement in order to protect the rights of Genesys hereunder. If Participant does not enforce the User license agreement within a reasonable time after discovery of the User’s actual or possible violation, then to the extent legally permitted, Participant hereby assigns its rights under such User license agreement to Genesys, but only to the extent necessary to enable Genesys to defend its Intellectual Property Rights.</p>
<p>
    10.<b> CONFIDENTIALITY</b></p>
<p>a. <u> “Confidential Information”</u> means the non-public information that is exchanged between the parties, provided that such information is: (a) identified as confidential at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party (“Discloser”), or (b) disclosed under circumstances that would indicate to a reasonable person that the information ought to be treated as confidential by the party receiving such information (“Recipient”).  A Recipient may use the Confidential Information that it receives from the other party solely for the purpose of performing activities contemplated under this Master Agreement.  Recipient shall not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party.  A Recipient shall protect it by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or publication as the Recipient uses to protect its own confidential information of a like nature.  The Recipient may disclose the Confidential Information to its Affiliates, agents and independent contractors with a need to know in order to fulfill the purpose of this Master Agreement, who are bound by nondisclosure obligations at least as protective of the Discloser’s rights as this Master Agreement.   </p>
<p>b.  This provision imposes no obligation upon a Recipient with respect to Confidential Information which: (i) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of such Recipient; (ii) was in the Recipient’s possession before receipt from the Discloser and was not subject to a duty of confidentiality; (iii) is rightfully received by the Recipient without any duty of confidentiality; (iv) is disclosed generally to a third party by the Discloser without a duty of confidentiality on the third party; or (v) is independently developed by the Recipient without use of the Confidential Information.</p>
<p>c.  The Recipient may disclose the Discloser's Confidential Information as required by law or court order provided: (i) Recipient promptly notifies the Discloser in writing of the requirement for disclosure affording opportunity for Discloser to take protective actions; and (ii) discloses only as much of the Confidential Information as is required, maintaining all proprietary notices affixed to such Confidential Information.  Upon request from the Discloser or upon termination of the Master Agreement, the Recipient shall return all Confidential Information and all copies, notes, summaries or extracts thereof or certify destruction of the same.  </p>
<p>d.  Each party will retain all right, title and interest to such party’s Confidential Information.  The parties acknowledge that a violation of the Recipient’s obligations with respect to Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the Discloser for which a remedy at law would be inadequate.  Therefore, in addition to any and all remedies available at law, Discloser shall be entitled to seek an injunction or other equitable remedies in all legal proceedings in the event of any threatened or actual violation of any or all of the provisions hereof.</p>

<p><b>11. AUDIT AND VERIFICATION</b></p>
<p>a.  Audit.   During the Term of this Master Agreement and for two (2) years thereafter, Participant shall keep complete and accurate records relating to Participant’s compliance with the provisions of this Master Agreement. Upon at least thirty (30) days prior notice, Participant shall permit Genesys or Genesys’s representatives, at Genesys expense (except as provided herein), to examine and copy its physical and electronic records during Participant’s regular business hours, and Participant shall reasonably cooperate with Genesys in examining such records, for the sole purpose of and only to the extent reasonably necessary to verify Participant’s compliance with the provisions this Master Agreement. If any such examination conducted by Genesys or its representatives determines any material non-compliance with the provisions of this Master Agreement (including without limitation, shortfall in Fees to Genesys), then, in addition to any legal remedies or equitable relief that may be available to Genesys, Participant shall be responsible for any expenses incurred by Genesys for any such examination. Without prejudice to the foregoing, if shortfall in payment to Genesys is so disclosed, Participant shall pay Genesys all amounts due within thirty (30) days of Genesys notification to Participant of such shortfall.</p>
