<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>Genesys<strong> Smart Finder</strong> is an application,&nbsp;<em>designed specifically for Genesys Solutions Consultants and Solution Architects</em>, that provides&nbsp;a quick, easy to use, and efficient way to find&nbsp;<strong>SC Engagement DSRs </strong>(SC DSRs)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>based on powerful search and filter criteria.</p>
<p>The below provides only a high-level view of Smart Finder capabilities and its usage.&nbsp; For more complete information, consult the help within Smart Finder itself, or the links to videos and documentation sent out with the announcement by the Sales COE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Searching for SC DSRs</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Smart Finder allows SC sDSRs to be searched in multiple ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All DSRs</strong> - search returns SC DSRs based on search criteria such as text in Account Name, Opportunity Name, and SC DSR Name<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Attachments</strong> - search returns SC DSRs that contain attachments based on the type of attachments contained within that DSR<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Virtual Team</strong> - search returns SC DSRs for which the selected individual is on the Virtual Team.&nbsp; This may also be used to find DSRs for which&nbsp;<strong>you</strong> are on the Virtual Team by clicking the&nbsp;<strong>My DSRs&nbsp;</strong>button.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><apex:image url="{!URLFOR($Resource.smartfinder,'Main.png')}" width="50%"/></p>
<p>A search will initially load the first&nbsp;<strong>500 </strong>DSRs from Salesforce that meets the search criteria.&nbsp; By clicking on the&nbsp;<strong>Get More</strong> button, an additional&nbsp;<strong>500</strong> DSRs from Salesforce, also matching the search criteria, will also be loaded.&nbsp; You may continue to click&nbsp;<strong>Get More</strong> until no futher results are returned.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><apex:image url="{!URLFOR($Resource.smartfinder,'dsr.png')}" width="50%"/></p>
<p>Once the search has been performed, the results may be further filtered as shown below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Filtering Your Results</h3>
<p>Once your search has returned DSRs, you may further filter the items currently loaded.&nbsp; Filtering does not re-perform the search to Salesforce, but instead applies the filter to DSRs that have already been found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of search you initially performed, you may filter these results based on text contained within the SC DSR Name, Account Name, and Opportunity Name.&nbsp; As you type the text, the list of DSRs in the gallery will be automatically updated based on how they match the filter text.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><apex:image url="{!URLFOR($Resource.smartfinder,'Filter.png')}" width="50%"/></p>
<h4>Advanced Filters</h4>
<p>Some search types will allow advanced filtering based on many different types of criter in the DSR.&nbsp; This can be accessed through the&nbsp;<strong>Edit Filters</strong> button, which will bring up a window to the right that will allow you to view and edit filters in affect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><apex:image url="{!URLFOR($Resource.smartfinder,'AdvancedFilters.png')}" width="25%"/></p>
<p>To change an advanced filter, select its desired value (or range of values) in the right side, and then set the toggle to&nbsp;<strong>Enabled</strong>.&nbsp; Upon changing filters, or changing a filter status between Disabled and Enabled, the list of DSRs will be immediately updated to reflect the changes.</p>
<p>Filters that are currently enabled and in use are shown with a <span style="color: green;">green</span> and those that are currently disabled are shown with a <span style="color: red;">red</span> background.&nbsp; &nbsp;You may reset the filters to default values (including setting all to disabled) by pressing the&nbsp;<strong>Reset Filters</strong> button.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, you may view a summary of all the filters by clicking on the&nbsp;<strong>Filter Summary</strong> button, which will summarize the filters in a popup dialog.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><apex:image url="{!URLFOR($Resource.smartfinder,'FilterSummary.png')}" width="50%"/></p>
<h2>Viewing Your Results</h2>
<p>Results of the search, including filters applied, will be shown on the left hand side of the screen in a gallery view.&nbsp; You can scroll this list to see additional DSRs that would not fit on the display.</p>
<p>The gallery view shows summary information about each DSR found.&nbsp; The information shown in this view is based on the type of search performed (ie: All DSRs, Attachments, or Virtual Team).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clicking on a DSR in the gallery view will load further information about the DSR into the right side of the screen.&nbsp; This screen provides a scrolling view of information within the DSR including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>DSR, Account, and Opportunity Name</li>
<li>Presales Priorities</li>
<li>Virtual Team Members</li>
<li>Use Cases and Blueprint Architectures</li>
<li>Attachments</li>
</ul>
<p>and more.&nbsp; Many of these items include links that may be clicked to either open the object within Salesforce or, in the case of Attachments or other documents, open the actual link to the document.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
