    <p> Please note that you should always compress any file before uploading them to Genesys.
     The typical Genesys log file compresses to roughly 5% to 10% of its original size, so using compression allows you to move them faster,
     and thus Genesys Support and Engineering will be able to access them more quickly.  Thank you.</p>
