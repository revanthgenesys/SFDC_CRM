Remote Alarm Monitoring is most effective when proactive log file retrieval is activated. First, download our Genesys Care Log File Management Tool (LFMT).

When an alarm notification comes in, you can quickly view the alarm details. As a Designated Contact, you can also view the alarm support case and manage the case via the mobile app. Once Remote Alarm Monitoring is activated, alarm data will be pushed out to your iOS or Android device.</p>
